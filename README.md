# Białowieskie Opowieści 2

A web application showcasing retellings of 31 local legends, fairy tales, and stories from the Białowieża region. This project presents a creative reinterpretation of the original book "Białowieskie opowieści" by Mikołaj Hajduk, published in 1990.

## About the Project

In 2025, on the 35th anniversary of the original publication, Natalka Suszczyńska (granddaughter of the original author) created retellings of all 31 stories from the book. This project was realized thanks to an artistic scholarship from the President of Białystok.

The stories are organized into five chapters:
- **Dlaczego zwierzęta nie żyją w zgodzie** (Why animals don't live in harmony)
- **Ludzie i zwierzęta** (People and animals)
- **Diabelskie figle** (Devilish tricks)
- **Tropami zbójców i rabusiów** (On the trail of robbers and thieves)
- **Gdy milknie dzwon** (When the bell falls silent)
